* Welcome to my homepage

I'm a PhD student at [[https://jiezhoucs.github.io/][Prof. Jie Zhou]]'s group at GWU CS. Before join GWU, I received my Bachelor's degree from the College of Software Engineering at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_University][Sichuan University]].

* Research Interests

I am interested in system security, programming languages, program analysis, and computer systems. Broadly, I aim to leverage theoretical techniques–such as type theory–to enhance the performance, robustness, and reliability of software systems. Currently, I am working on a memory safety project. My ultimate goal is to build fault-free softwares.

* Philosophy

I believe that to resist this ramshackle world, we must build our inner world from scratch–intentionally and independently–rather than trying to subtract chaos from a flawed system, just as Thoreau did in /Walden/.

Instead of passively following every evolution this boundless world undergoes, we should deliberately choose a few domains and pursue depth and growth within them.
